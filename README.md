# Krasis

Krasis is an LLM runtime for running large MoE models on NVIDIA consumer GPUs.
It is built around fast GPU prompt processing, GPU-executed decode, and HCS
expert residency management so models much larger than VRAM can still run
locally.

The current runtime is no longer the early Python-hot-path prototype. The
serving path is Rust/CUDA focused: Python is used for launcher/setup/model
loading work, while the performance-sensitive runtime path uses Rust/CUDA
orchestration, CUDA kernels, cached quantized weights, and measured VRAM
budgeting.

## Install

The current release is
[`v1.0.16`](https://github.com/brontoguana/krasis/releases/tag/v1.0.16).

**Native Windows:** [Download the Krasis Windows installer](https://github.com/brontoguana/krasis/releases/download/v1.0.16/KrasisSetup-1.0.16-win64.exe).
It installs Krasis for the current user, includes its own Python runtime, and
adds `Krasis` to the Start Menu.

**Linux or WSL2:**

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontoguana/krasis/main/install.sh | bash -s -- prerelease
```

## What Krasis Does

- Runs multi-hundred-billion-parameter MoE models from BF16 safetensors on
  commodity NVIDIA GPU systems.
- Uses full GPU prefill for fast prompt processing.
- Uses GPU-executed decode with HCS managing hot/cold expert residency between
  VRAM and CPU RAM.
- Builds cached INT4/INT8 expert formats and HQQ attention caches under
  `~/.krasis`.
- Supports compact KV cache modes including `k6v6` Quality and `k4v4` Ultra
  Compact.
- Provides an interactive launcher, OpenAI-compatible API, chat client,
  reproducible benchmarks, and GitHub-release based installation.
- Translates each supported model family's native tool-call syntax into
  OpenAI-compatible structured `tool_calls`, including streaming responses and
  multi-turn tool results.

## Major Changes Since The Previous Stable Release

The current release line is a major change from `v0.1.64`, the previous stable
Krasis release. Highlights:

- Runtime hot-path work moved out of Python and into Rust/CUDA for serving,
  decode orchestration, timing, HCS operations, and benchmark-critical paths.
- Added HQQ attention support, including HQQ4, HQQ6, HQQ8, auto mixed profiles,
  cache build/rebuild support, and HQQ benchmark/validation lanes.
- Added compact KV cache formats, including `k6v6` and `k4v4`, with `k6v6`
  as the quality-oriented launcher default and `k4v4` for tighter VRAM budgets.
- Added full Ampere support for the current production path. HQQ attention and
  compact KV cache modes were built with Ampere compatibility in mind and do
  not require FP8-capable hardware.
- Expanded validated model coverage across DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731,
  DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp, Qwen3-Coder-Next, Qwen3/3.5/3.6, Ornith,
  Step-3.7-Flash, Gemma 4, and Nemotron MoE families. See the current per-family
  quality and tool-use limitations below rather than assuming every quantized
  runtime is equally faithful.
- Added and hardened HCS expert residency management: measured startup
  calibration, prompt-conditioned reload, dynamic recency tail, per-stage
  budgets, soft-tier reload caps, and safe eviction/reload paths.
- Added runtime VRAM safety systems: short/long prefill/decode calibration,
  measured scratch budgets, pressure detection, idle pressure drain, and hard
  exit protection before CUDA enters an unsafe OOM state.
- Added full GitHub release wheel packaging for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and
  3.13, with vendored CUDA sidecars injected into wheels.
- Added a native Windows installer with a private Python runtime, interactive
  launcher, and a maximized Start Menu entry.
- Added `krasis update` and `krasis prerelease` maintenance commands.
- Added an interactive curated Hugging Face downloader flow in the launcher.
- Added reverse SSH tunnel support for exposing a local Krasis server to a
  remote machine through SSH without opening public ports.
- Added repeatable benchmark and release-test commands, benchmark log archival,
  llama-witness based correctness validation, and richer diagnostics.
- Removed Session messenger integration and other stale prototype-era surfaces.
- Cleaned terminal/log output so human console lines are clean while prefixed
  records go to log files.
- Deprecated AWQ and Polar4 for new production runs. Current production
  surfaces use HQQ attention plus `k6v6`, `k4v4`, or BF16 KV depending on the
  memory/quality target.

## Tradeoffs And Requirements

- Krasis currently targets NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA, including Ampere and newer
  architectures. The production HQQ attention and compact KV cache modes do not
  require FP8 support.
- Input models should be BF16 safetensors from Hugging Face or another local
  safetensors source.
- First run is slower because Krasis builds optimized local caches. Later runs
  reuse those caches.
- Disk usage must cover the source model plus Krasis cache artifacts under
  `~/.krasis`.
- System RAM should be sized for the selected quantized cache and HCS backing
  store. Larger models need substantial RAM even when GPU VRAM is limited.
- Production runs should use quantized INT4/INT8 expert caches and HQQ
  attention. BF16-heavy modes are validation/debug modes, not normal deployment
  targets.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Native x86-64 Windows, Linux (including Ubuntu 24.04+), or WSL2
- Python 3.10+ on Linux/WSL; native Windows uses the release-pinned private
  Python included by the installer
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA drivers installed
- Rust is only needed for source builds, not normal wheel installs
- Enough disk/RAM for the source model and generated Krasis caches

### 1. Install Krasis

Linux/WSL:

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontoguana/krasis/main/install.sh | bash -s -- prerelease
```

This creates a managed environment at `~/.krasis/venv`, installs Krasis,
symlinks commands into `~/.local/bin`, and updates PATH for the current shell.
No sudo is required for the Krasis install itself. Omit `prerelease` when
installing the latest stable release.

Native Windows:

[Download `KrasisSetup-1.0.16-win64.exe`](https://github.com/brontoguana/krasis/releases/download/v1.0.16/KrasisSetup-1.0.16-win64.exe).
The installer creates a per-user install under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Krasis`, installs and validates a release-pinned
private Python/Krasis/PyTorch runtime, and adds `Krasis` and `Krasis Manager`
shortcuts to the Start Menu folder. It never uses or modifies a system Python.
`Krasis` opens the native interactive launcher in a maximized, resizable
console; `Krasis Manager` starts the localhost management dashboard. Models
and caches still live under
`%USERPROFILE%\.krasis`. The first install downloads the pinned CUDA PyTorch
wheel and can take several minutes.

Native Windows packages Marlin, FlashAttention, and FLA sidecars for supported
Ampere and newer NVIDIA architectures.

### 2. Install CUDA Dependencies

```bash
krasis-setup
```

This installs runtime CUDA/PyTorch dependencies when needed. It is usually only
required once per machine.

### 3. Download A Model

Run:

```bash
krasis
```

Then use the interactive launcher to choose from Krasis-supported Hugging Face
models, or put BF16 safetensors manually under `~/.krasis/models/`.

Manual download example:

```bash
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-Next \
    --local-dir ~/.krasis/models/Qwen3-Coder-Next
```

### 4. Run

```bash
krasis
```

The launcher walks through model selection, GPU selection, quantization/runtime
options, and server startup. Settings are saved under `~/.krasis/config`.

## Updating

On Linux or WSL:

```bash
# Latest stable release
krasis update

# Latest pre-release
krasis prerelease

# Uninstall Krasis, keeping model files
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontoguana/krasis/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

On native Windows, download and run the desired stable or prerelease installer
from the [Krasis releases page](https://github.com/brontoguana/krasis/releases).

## WSL2

Krasis works on WSL2. By default WSL often limits available memory, which is
usually too small for large MoE models. Create or edit:

```text
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.wslconfig
```

Example:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=120GB
```

Adjust the value to leave memory for Windows, then restart WSL from PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

## Usage

### Interactive Launcher

```bash
krasis
```

The launcher provides:

- model selection from local models
- curated Hugging Face model download for supported models
- GPU selection, including selected GPU indices
- quantization, HQQ attention, KV cache, HCS, and VRAM safety settings
- optional reverse SSH tunnel target
- benchmark/run choices

### Krasis Manager

```bash
krasis manager
```

Krasis Manager is a Rust control plane and dashboard bound by default to
`127.0.0.1:8090`. It discovers every NVIDIA GPU by stable UUID and shows the
verified Krasis model, process, port, configuration, and VRAM use assigned to
each GPU. Click a GPU to select an installed model, edit launcher-qualified
HQQ, KV, memory, serving, multi-GPU, and SSH-forwarding settings, then validate
or Apply them. Stop safely terminates only a process re-verified as a Krasis
model server. Apply validates the complete proposal before stopping the
current model.

Apply and Stop are asynchronous. The page shows validation, shutdown, GPU
release, launch, loading/calibration, ready, stopped, and failed progress with
bounded startup logs. The same state is available from the versioned JSON API.
Thorough copyable `curl` and PowerShell instructions are included on
the Manager page for agents, including discovery, validation, Apply,
progress polling, and Stop. Mutating requests require the owner-only token in
`~/.krasis/manager/token`.

On native Windows, open the dedicated **Krasis Manager** Start Menu shortcut or
run:

```powershell
Krasis.exe manager
```

Use `krasis manager --help` to select a different port or suppress automatic
browser opening.

To make Manager available on the local network, opt in explicitly:

```bash
krasis manager --lan --port 8080
```

LAN mode binds to `0.0.0.0`, accepts requests only when the Host address
matches the exact destination interface and port, and requires the owner token
for every API request. Open `http://<machine-lan-ip>:8080/` from another
machine and enter the token stored at `~/.krasis/manager/token` (or
`%USERPROFILE%\.krasis\manager\token` on Windows). Do not expose Manager to
the public internet; it serves HTTP rather than TLS. The host firewall must
permit the selected port on the private network; Krasis does not silently add
or broaden firewall rules.

### Non-Interactive Launch

```bash
# Use saved config
krasis --non-interactive

# Use a config file
krasis --config tests/qcn-k4v4-hqq8-int4-benchmark.conf

# Override selected values
krasis --non-interactive --model-path /path/to/model --selected-gpus 0,2 --benchmark
```

Common options:

- `--attention-quant hqq6` or `hqq8`
- `--kv-dtype k6v6`, `k4v4`, or `bf16`
- `--gpu-expert-bits 4` or `8`
- `--vram-safety-margin 600`
- `--dynamic-hcs` / `--no-dynamic-hcs`
- `--prefix-cache` / `--no-prefix-cache` (enabled by default)
- `--prefix-cache-ram-fraction 0.25`
- `--ssh-tunnel user@host`
- `--ssh-key-path ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

For the full option surface, run:

```bash
krasis --help
```

### Chat Client

```bash
krasis chat
krasis chat --prompt "Explain HCS in one paragraph"
krasis chat --file prompts.txt
krasis chat --port 8013
krasis chat --url http://host:8012
```

The standalone command also remains available:

```bash
krasis-chat
```

### API

Krasis exposes an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint:

```text
http://localhost:8012/v1/chat/completions
```

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /v1/timing`

### Vision

`DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp` uses the same OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint
for text and images. Select `BF16` vision weights in the launcher (or pass
`--vision-quant bf16`); this is the accuracy-qualified mode for the released
vision tower. The model record returned by `GET /v1/models` reports
`"vision": true` when image execution is available.

Send images in a `user` message using an OpenAI `image_url` content part. Data
URLs and HTTP(S) URLs are supported:

```json
{
  "model": "MODEL_ID_FROM_V1_MODELS",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,..."}
        },
        {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The released DeepSeek contract accepts images only in `user` turns. Local
filesystem image paths remain disabled unless the operator explicitly enables
them with `KRASIS_ALLOW_LOCAL_IMAGE_PATHS=1`.

### Tool Use

Send OpenAI-compatible `tools` with a chat-completions request. Krasis renders
the tools using the loaded checkpoint's own chat template, then translates the
model's native output grammar into structured OpenAI `tool_calls`. This works
for streaming and non-streaming responses, multiple calls in one turn, typed
arguments, and subsequent `tool`-role results.

Supported template families include DeepSeek-V4 DSML, Qwen JSON, Qwen
function XML (Qwen3-Coder-Next, Qwen3.5/3.6, Ornith, Step-3.7 and Nemotron),
GLM argument XML, Gemma 4 and MiniMax. A tools request fails visibly if the
loaded template does not declare a supported output grammar; Krasis never
silently treats a valid native tool block as assistant text. Malformed or
truncated blocks remain visible as text. DeepSeek-V2/V2-Lite and
DeepSeek-VL2 currently have no tool grammar in their shipped fallback template
and are therefore not tool-use capable.

Grammar transport support is distinct from live model validation. Some model
and client combinations have runtime or context limitations. In particular,
Nemotron-3-Super's current INT4/HQQ4 runtime does not reliably emit tool calls
and shows substantial autoregressive degradation on a difficult llama-witness
sequence even though the rendered tool prompt matches Hugging Face exactly.
Large agent policies and many tool schemas can also exceed smaller models'
contexts or degrade tool selection; Step and Gemma completed live Opencode
round trips with concise agent prompts. The per-family table records parser
coverage separately from current end-to-end evidence.

See [Advanced Configuration](ADVANCED.md#tool-use) for the per-family support
table.

### Benchmarks

Use the fixed speed-regression entry point for repeatable Qwen3-Coder-Next
speed checks:

```bash
./dev speed-test
```

Run a standard benchmark for a config:

```bash
./dev benchmark tests/qcn-k4v4-hqq8-int4-benchmark.conf
```

Run a benchmark from the installed command:

```bash
krasis --config tests/qcn-k4v4-hqq8-int4-benchmark.conf --benchmark
```

### Source Build

For development builds:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brontoguana/krasis.git
cd krasis
./dev build
./dev run qcn
```

DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 is available as `./dev run dsv4` (also
`deepseek-v4`). Fresh launcher selections use INT4 experts, HQQ6 attention, and
the architecture-owned `Native` cache. HQQ6 measured `4.838535` WikiText-2
perplexity, `+0.466%` versus HQQ8/Native, and passed the four-prompt witness.
The measured HQQ8/expanded-BF16 comparison profile matched the accepted BF16
quality gate and measured
30.08/29.86/29.29 tok/s internal decode for 50/100/250-token outputs. An
explicit `Native` cache stores the checkpoint's existing E4M3/E2M1 QAT state
without a second quantizer and increases the measured 1,000 MiB context capacity
from 149,808 to 294,432 tokens. Native currently regresses 1K/5K prefill by
8.45%/6.22% against expanded BF16 while remaining effectively flat at 10K and
above; the launcher nevertheless defaults to Native to prioritize context
capacity, with expanded BF16 retained as an explicit faster-short-prefill mode.

The `./dev` entry point handles environment setup and is preferred for local
development commands. Its general config shortcuts are `qcn`, `dsv4`, and
`gemma`; pass an explicit validated `.conf` path for other models. Shortcuts
that resolved to deprecated KV configurations were removed rather than kept as
commands that fail at startup.
